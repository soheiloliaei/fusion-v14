- Design element extraction (color, typography, layout, interaction, navigation)
- User needs assessment (accessibility, mobile-friendly, performance, simplicity)
- Constraint identification (budget, time, existing systems)
- Target audience analysis (business, consumer, technical, general users)

**Design Principles Applied**:
1. User-centered design (always applied)
2. Accessibility first (when accessibility is a user need)
3. Consistent visual hierarchy (for UI and general design)
4. Clear information architecture (for UX and general design)
5. Responsive design patterns (when mobile-friendly is needed)
6. Performance optimization (when performance is a user need)
7. Brand consistency (for brand design)

**Output Structure**:
- Enhanced output with design recommendations
- Confidence scoring based on analysis quality
- Tool usage tracking
- Shared state updates
- Execution time metrics

### Evaluator Agent
**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation and scoring across multiple criteria

1. **Clarity** (15% weight): How clear and understandable is the output?
2. **Completeness** (15% weight): How complete is the response to the request?
3. **Actionability** (20% weight): How actionable are the recommendations?
4. **Accuracy** (15% weight): How accurate is the information provided?
5. **Relevance** (15% weight): How relevant is the output to the input?
6. **Innovation** (10% weight): How innovative or creative is the approach?
7. **Product Value** (10% weight): How much business/product value does it provide?

**Evaluation Process**:
- Context extraction from input
- Multi-criteria evaluation with weighted scoring
- Reasoning generation for each criterion
- Overall confidence calculation
- Detailed evaluation report generation

**Quality Assessment**:
- Excellent Quality (≥0.9): Ready for production use

- Acceptable Quality (≥0.7): Some improvements needed
- Needs Improvement (<0.7): Significant enhancements required

## Tool System

### UX Audit Tool
**Purpose**: Comprehensive UX analysis using heuristic evaluation and metrics

**Heuristic Evaluation** (Nielsen's 10 heuristics):
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

**UX Metrics Analysis**:
- **Usability**: ease_of_use, learnability, efficiency
- **Accessibility**: wcag_compliance, screen_reader, keyboard_navigation
- **Performance**: load_time, response_time, smoothness
- **Engagement**: user_retention, time_on_site, interaction_rate

**Output**: Comprehensive UX audit report with specific recommendations

### Trust Explainer Tool
**Purpose**: Trust-building analysis and enhancement recommendations

**Trust Elements Analysis**:
- **Transparency**: clear_pricing, data_usage, privacy_policy, terms_of_service
- **Security**: encryption, secure_payment, data_protection, compliance
- **Social Proof**: reviews, testimonials, user_count, expert_endorsements
- **Reliability**: uptime, performance, support_quality, update_frequency
- **Expertise**: credentials, experience, certifications, industry_recognition

**Trust Indicators Evaluation**:
- **Visual**: professional_design, brand_consistency, quality_icons, modern_ui
- **Content**: clear_messaging, helpful_information, transparent_processes, educational_content
- **Interaction**: responsive_feedback, error_handling, loading_states, progress_indicators
- **Social**: user_reviews, social_media, community_features, expert_opinions

**Output**: Trust enhancement plan with specific implementation strategies

## Pattern System

### Pattern Registry
**Purpose**: Intelligent pattern management with fallback mechanisms

**Built-in Patterns**:
1. **design_enhancement**: Apply design principles and accessibility
2. **ux_audit**: Perform comprehensive UX audit
3. **trust_building**: Analyze and enhance trust elements
4. **comprehensive_evaluation**: Full evaluation with detailed scoring
5. **basic_evaluation**: Essential evaluation criteria

**Pattern Features**:
- Smart pattern matching based on input keywords
- Confidence-based pattern application
- Fallback system for low-confidence results
- Performance tracking and statistics
- Custom pattern creation capabilities

**Pattern Selection Logic**:
- Design-related inputs → design_enhancement, ux_audit, or trust_building
- Evaluation-related inputs → comprehensive_evaluation
- Default fallback → design_enhancement

## Memory and Context Management

### Fusion Context
**Purpose**: Shared state and memory management across all agents and tools

**Memory Components**:
